## Assignment Details

i. **Object Modeling Techniques (OMT)**
Object Modeling Techniques (OMT) is a methodology for visualizing and designing software systems using object-oriented concepts. It involves techniques for modeling systems, such as object diagrams, class diagrams, and other UML-based representations.

ii. **Comparison between OOAD and OOP**
- **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD):** This is a methodology focused on analyzing, designing, and modeling systems using object-oriented concepts, tools, and techniques to create robust and adaptable systems.
- **Object Analysis and Design (OOP):** OOP is more focused on the practical implementation of object-oriented principles in coding. It's about using the concepts derived from OOAD to create actual object-oriented programs.

iii. **Main goals of UML (Unified Modeling Language)**
UML aims to provide a standard language for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems. Its primary goals include:
- Fostering communication among stakeholders
- Facilitating understanding of system design
- Enabling visualization and documentation of system architecture.

iv. **Advantages of Object-Oriented Development**
Three advantages include:
- **Reusability:** Objects and classes can be reused in various parts of the system, reducing redundancy and promoting efficiency in development.
- **Modularity:** Systems can be broken down into smaller, manageable parts (objects) that can be independently developed, tested, and maintained.
- **Easier Maintenance:** OOP allows for easier updates and maintenance as changes in one part of the system donâ€™t affect other parts if encapsulation is implemented effectively.

v. **Types of associations between objects**
- **Aggregation:** Represents a "whole-part" relationship where one class contains objects of another class without strict ownership.
- **Composition:** Stronger form of aggregation where the child object cannot exist without the parent object.
- **Association:** Defines a relationship between two classes, indicating how they are related without implying any ownership or lifecycle dependency.

Vii. **Class Diagram**
A class diagram is a visual representation used in software engineering to illustrate the structure of a system. It shows classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. Steps to draw a class diagram involve:
- Identifying classes and their attributes.
- Adding methods and relationships between classes.
- Using appropriate UML notations to represent classes, associations, etc.
