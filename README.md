OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 2 ASSIGNMENT

i. Object Modeling Techniques (OMT)
Object Modeling Techniques (OMT) is a methodology for visualizing and designing software systems using object-oriented concepts. It involves techniques for modeling systems, such as object diagrams, class diagrams, and other UML-based representations.

ii. Comparison between OOAD and OOP
Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD): This is a methodology focused on analyzing, designing, and modeling systems using object-oriented concepts, tools, and techniques to create robust and adaptable systems.
Object Analysis and Design (OOP): OOP is more focused on the practical implementation of object-oriented principles in coding. It's about using the concepts derived from OOAD to create actual object-oriented programs.

iii.  Main goals of UML (Unified Modeling Language)
UML aims to provide a standard language for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems. Its primary goals include: -
a. a) fostering communication among stakeholders
b. b) facilitating understanding of system design
c. c) enabling visualization and documentation of system architecture.

iv. Advantages of Object-Oriented Development
Three advantages include:
a. Reusability: Objects and classes can be reused in various parts of the system, reducing redundancy and promoting efficiency in development.
b. Modularity: Systems can be broken down into smaller, manageable parts (objects) that can be independently developed, tested, and maintained.
c. Easier Maintenance: OOP allows for easier updates and maintenance as changes in one part of the system donâ€™t affect other parts if encapsulation is implemented effectively.

v. Types of associations between objects
a. Aggregation: Represents a "whole-part" relationship where one class contains objects of another class without strict ownership.
b. Composition: Stronger form of aggregation where the child object cannot exist without the parent object.
c. Association: Defines a relationship between two classes, indicating how they are related without implying any ownership or lifecycle dependency.


Vii.      Class Diagram
A class diagram is a visual representation used in software engineering to illustrate the structure of a system. It shows classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. Steps to draw a class diagram involve:
a. Identifying classes and their attributes.
b. Adding methods and relationships between classes.
c. Using appropriate UML notations to represent classes, associations, etc
